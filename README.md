# 2D GAME ENGINE
Simple single player  2d engine using its custom Physics System and Animation system is written in ECS style to make it modular and easily readable. written in C++ using SFML.

# Where are we now? 
The Animation of this 2d is still faulty. First we used a single sprite image file to create some animation based on the label of each frame on the sprite image e.g like if the sprite image has like an idle and walk and run then each animation is resolved  based on the frame selected. This way might be inconsistent but the animation is sort of rendered.
